Challenge 1 - Count each nucleotide (A,C,G,T) in DNA file. countDNA.py

Challenge 2 - Convert DNA nucleotides (A,C,G,T) to RNA nucleotides (A,C,G,U). dnatorna.py

Challenge 3 - Create complimentary DNA strand to ssDNA provided. complimentDNA.py

Challenge 4 - Takes a DNA file and a motif file. Searches the DNA file and prints the location of each motif. motifInDNA.py

Challenge 5 - Point Mutations. Measures the number of point mutations and returns the Hamming Distance between two strings.

      Takes a DNA sequence, creates the palindrome sequence, prints it and searches for palindromes in length from 4 to 12 nucleotides. This program finds and prints the location and length of each palindrome within the given sequence.
